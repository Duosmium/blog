Wow, it's been a minute since we've posted an update. Here's what the Duosmium team has been up to lately.

## Competitions

We've been hard at work adding results to Duosmium. Right now, we're up to **866 tournaments!** As always, we are immensely grateful to all of our community contributors, whose work has made up the bulk of our new uploads over the last few months.

In addition, we've been happy to help tournaments publish their results through Duosmium. In addition to a variety of invitationals happening everywhere from Boston[^1] to Berkeley, we are also proud to announce our partnerships with [Virginia Science Olympiad](https://www.virginiaso.org) and [Southern California Science Olympiad](https://www.socalscioly.org)! All regional and state results in Virginia and SoCal will be published through Duosmium, and we're excited to collaborate with both organizations.

On another note:

Thanks again for your support!

## Redesign

Now for the bigger news. You've probably heard rumors about it. (Sorry -- we can't help ourselves!)

If you read our update from [a year ago](/posts/feb22), you'll remember that we released an improved version of the Duosmium website around this time last year. Our new site, written using the [11ty](https://11ty.dev) static site generator and a lot of JavaScript, massively improved build times over its predecessor and was much easier to add new features to.

But it's not perfect. What if there was a Duosmium Results where you could add results without spreadsheets? Where your event supervisors could log in and score their events? Maybe you wouldn't need a maintainer to upload stuff for you. Maybe -- *gasp!* -- [there would actually be dark mode](https://github.com/Duosmium/duosmium/issues/6). Audacious? Sure. But that hasn't stopped us from trying.

We're excited to announce that **Duosmium Results is being redesigned from the ground up!** We'll be building the website from scratch and designing a whole new experience catered towards everyone in the Science Olympiad community, from competitors to tournament directors to developers and data scientists. What will it look like? We don't know yet, because we want to hear from you -- yes, you! If you've ever had any complaints about Duosmium, or just wished the site could have something cool, let us know! This is your best chance to see it become a reality. Shoot us an email at [ideas@duosmium.org](mailto:ideas@duosmium.org) and you never know what might happen. Also, if you have experience with any of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Svelte, or MongoDB and want to be involved with a super-cool project, reach out! We can always use some help.

Our goal is to have the new site ready in time for the 2023-24 season, so keep an eye out!

That's all for now. See you soon!

Regards,

Jason, Shreyas, and Tomi
