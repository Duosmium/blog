Welcome to the new Duosmium blog! We're excited to roll this site out as a space to share thoughts about Science Olympiad. We'll also be using the "Duosmium News" section of this website to be discussing our own work on Duosmium-related projects.

## Summer 2021 Updates

School is out, which means it's time for upgrades to Duosmium Results! Some of the things we're working on:

* We're overhauling `sciolyff`'s implementation of tracks (aka subdivisions) to include new features for handling per-track differences (e.g. different medalling places per track).
* We're also working on adding per-event medals when needed (e.g. nationals, which usually does top-6 for most events but top-3 for trials).
* The results website can take a while to build, and some portions of it don't scale as well as others to a growing site. That's why we're investigating new technologies to speed up build times, creating a more efficient system and reducing the wait for new tournament results.
* And of course, we're hard at work fixing canonicalization issues and adding historical data to the site.
