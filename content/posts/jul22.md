## Join the Community!

For the last year and a half, the Duosmium team has used a Discord server to discuss the project and brainstorm new ideas. Today, we're proud to announce that we're opening the server up to the public! Anyone interested in Duosmium is welcome to join the server and get involved.

You can join the server at this link: https://discord.gg/D6H5KNScHB We can't wait to see you in the server!

That's all for now. See you soon!
