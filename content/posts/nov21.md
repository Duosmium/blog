Hi all!

As we start the 2021 season and enter into the Fall, we've already hosted our first results through our platform, the University of Texas at Austin's Invitational, [Division B](https://www.duosmium.org/results/2021-10-30_ut_austin_invitational_b) and [Division C](https://www.duosmium.org/results/2021-10-30_ut_austin_invitational_c). Keep an eye out for more official results on Duosmium in the near future! (Next up: Rickards Invitational this upcoming weekend!)

As always, if you're interested in hosting your upcoming competition's results on Duosmium, email us at [admin@duosmium.org](admin@duosmium.org)!

Regards,
Shreyas and Jason
The Duosmium Team
